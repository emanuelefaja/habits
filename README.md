With habits, you can track various different types of habits, including:

- Binary: Choose whether you did or didn't do the habit (i.e. did you meditate, did you exercise, etc.)
- Options: Choose from a set of options (i.e. your mood, your rating, etc.)
- Number: Track a number (i.e. how many times you did the habit)
- Set-Reps: Track a set of reps (i.e. how many sets and reps you did)

For each habit type, you also have the ability to drill down into the habit to see your progress over time and some interesting statistics:
