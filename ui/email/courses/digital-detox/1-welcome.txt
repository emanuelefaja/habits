Hi {{.FirstName}},

Welcome to the Digital Detox course! Over the next two weeks, I'll guide you through practical steps to reduce your digital dependence and regain control of your attention.

In this course, you'll learn:
- Why our brains crave digital distraction
- How to identify your personal digital triggers
- Practical techniques to break the cycle of constant checking
- How to build sustainable habits for a healthier relationship with technology

"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." â€” Henry David Thoreau

Let's start with a simple exercise:

DAY 1 EXERCISE: DIGITAL AWARENESS
For the next 24 hours, I'd like you to simply notice your digital habits without judgment:
- How many times do you reach for your phone without thinking?
- What triggers you to check devices (boredom, notifications, anxiety)?
- How do you feel immediately after using your devices?

Don't try to change anything yet. Just observe and take mental notes. Awareness is the first step toward change.

Tomorrow, we'll discuss what you observed and introduce the concept of "digital minimalism" - a philosophy that can help you reclaim your attention and focus.

I'm excited to be on this journey with you!

Talk soon,
