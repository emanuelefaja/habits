    <h2>1. The Shocking Amount of Time (and Life) You May Be Losing to Your Phone</h2>
    
    <p>Hey {{.FirstName}},</p>
    
    <p>Manny and Mike here.</p>
    
    <p>We didn't want to start with a downer. But we've decided to do so.</p>
    
    <p>Because if you're reading this email, there's part of you that wants to change. And new habits sometimes start best when you recognize you have a problem.</p>
    
    <p>Consider this: the average person loses 2-4 hours every single day on their phone. That's 14-28 hours a week. 14 working days a month. 168 working days a year.</p>
    
    <p>To put this in perspective: Think about college. College = 4 years of your life. A significant chunk, right?</p>
    
    <p>Here's what's crazy. The average person will spend 3x more time on their phone than in college alone – that's 12 years total!</p>

    <p>Let. That. Sink. In.</p>
    
    <p>We are literally losing our lives to our phones. The precious moments of your life slipping away, pixel by pixel. Hour by hour.</p>
    
    <p>On the bright side, in this mini-course you'll learn how to reclaim 2-4 hours a day back to your life immediately.</p>
    
    <p>That's the time you "don't have" to finally get in shape.</p>
    
    <p>That's time to devote to your most important relationships.</p>
    
    <p>That's a side hustle, waiting to be born.</p>
    
    <p>A hobby, itching to be discovered.</p>
    
    <p>A novel, waiting to be written.</p>
    
    <p>A life, eager to be lived.</p>
    
    <p>Ready to break free? Keep reading.</p>

    <h2>2. The Surprising Truth About Addiction</h2>
    
    <p>57% of Americans admit to being addicted to their phones. In Asia, the rates are higher.</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever considered that you might be addicted too?</p>
    
    <p>Now, you might say, "I'm not an addict type. I don't go on blackout benders. I don't gamble. My life is relatively normal. Heck, I even eat my vegetables!"</p>
    
    <p>But as Dr. Jud Brewer, one of the world's top habit and addiction psychiatrists, says:</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "(Addiction) isn't just the use of chemicals such as nicotine, alcohol and heroin. It's bigger than that. The simple definition of addiction is this: continued use despite adverse consequences."
    </div>
    
    <p>So the better question is this: Is your phone usage negatively impacting your life in big or small ways? Despite these negative impacts, do you keep doing it every day?</p>
    
    <p>If yes, the harsh truth is, you fit the classic definition of being an addict.</p>

    
    <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 8px; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px;">A few signs of phone addiction, include:</p>

            <p style="margin: 8px 0;">☐ You feel guilty or disgusted after being on your phone for a long time</p>

    <p>If you check at least a couple of these boxes, your addiction is light.</p>
    
    <p>If you check more, you are more addicted than you realize.</p>
    
    <p>You're not alone. The majority of the world suffers from phone addiction and they don't even know it.</p>
    
    <p>Being stuck on our phones is the new smoking of our generation.</p>
    
    <p>The good news is: breaking phone addiction is much easier than quitting smoking.</p>
    
    <p>Ready to take back control? See you tomorrow!</p>
