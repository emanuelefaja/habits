    <p>Let's start with a simple exercise:</p>
    
    <h2>Day 1 Exercise: Digital Awareness</h2>
    <p>For the next 24 hours, I'd like you to simply notice your digital habits without judgment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How many times do you reach for your phone without thinking?</li>
        <li>What triggers you to check devices (boredom, notifications, anxiety)?</li>
        <li>How do you feel immediately after using your devices?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Don't try to change anything yet. Just observe and take mental notes. Awareness is the first step toward change.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow, we'll discuss what you observed and introduce the concept of "digital minimalism" - a philosophy that can help you reclaim your attention and focus.</p>
    
    <p>I'm excited to be on this journey with you!</p>
