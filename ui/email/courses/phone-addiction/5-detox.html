    <p>Hey {{.FirstName}},</p>
    
    <p>Manny and Mike here, bringing you to the culmination of our Breaking Phone Addiction mini-course.</p>
    
    <p>Over the past four days, we've explored the grip of phone addiction, the manipulative tactics of technology, and practical strategies to reclaim your time and attention.</p>

    <p>Now, it's time to take a leap. It's time to feel the difference.</p>
    
    <p>We can talk about the benefits of reduced screen time until we're blue in the face. We can share statistics, scientific studies, and inspiring anecdotes. But nothing will resonate as deeply as your own personal experience.</p>
    
    <p>Think back to Day 1. </p>
    
    <p>We asked you to consider the hours you're losing to your phone. Imagine what you could do with just one full day – 24 hours – completely unplugged.</p>
    
    <p>This isn't about deprivation; it's about rediscovery. It's about creating space to notice the things you've been missing while your attention has been tethered to a screen. The warmth of the sun on your skin. The laughter of loved ones. The quiet satisfaction of completing a task without interruption. The simple joy of taking a walk with nowhere to go.</p>

    <h2>1. How to do a 24-Hour Digital Detox</h2>
    
    <p>So what is a 24-Hour Digital Detox?</p>
    
    <p>This means turning off your smartphone, staying off social media, no streaming, no news, no internet browsing on other devices, and intentionally engaging with the physical world around you for 24 hours.</p>
    
    <p>Think of it as an experiment. A chance to hit the reset button and see what emerges when you remove the constant digital noise.</p>
    
    <p>Here's how to make it happen:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose your day</strong> - Look at your calendar for the next 7 days and identify a 24-hour period that will work best for you. Maybe it's a weekend day, or perhaps a day off during the week.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold yourself accountable</strong> - Write it down in your calendar, set a reminder, and tell someone close to you about your plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare</strong> - Think about how you'll spend your time. Do you want to plan your day in advance, leave things to serendipity, or somewhere in between? If you do make plans, do you need pre-arrange rides, print maps, or make reservations? Not sure what to do? More ideas below.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate (If necessary)</strong> - Let select people know in advance that you'll be unavailable digitally for this period.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup plan</strong> - In the case that you MUST use your phone OR someone must reach you (i.e. you are stranded and need a ride OR you are expecting a call from a loved one), then of course, it's ok to use your phone. Just keep this as minimal as possible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. The 4Ps of Digital Detoxing</h2>
    
    <p>Not sure what to do with your 24 hours? We recommend doing one of the 4Ps:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Present Activities</strong> - Do things that make you feel present. Have a potluck with your friends or family. Do yoga. Go for a walk in the woods. Have a picnic in the park. Paint. Ponder. Enjoy the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Activities</strong> - Do things that recharge your battery. Read a book. Journal. Workout. Go for a run. Get a massage. Swim. Refresh yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Play Activities</strong> - Find your inner child and loosen up a bit. Play a sport. Throw a frisbee. Let your dog take you for an adventure. Get some friends together. Cause some trouble.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Activities</strong> - Do something chunky that you've been pushing off or dragging your feet about. Clean the house. Write that chapter. Start that side hustle. Manage your finances. Get it done. Feel great afterwards.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This 24-hour Digital Detox is your opportunity to experience the clarity, calm, and connection that can return to your life when you intentionally step away from the digital world.</p>
    
    <p>We believe in you. Pick your date, commit to the challenge, and rediscover the beauty of life before a digital world.</p>
    
    <p>All the best,</p>
    <p>Manny and Mike</p>
