        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you start using your phone less, you may find yourself confused at first (i.e. reaching your phone and realizing it's not next to your bed anymore). <br><br>This is normal! <br><br>That new 'space' is an ideal opportunity to experiment with new routines that you feel great about.</p>

    <p>Hey {{.FirstName}},</p>
    
    <p>Manny and Mike back, pushing you closer to phone freedom!</p>
    
    <p>Yesterday, we armed you with powerful environmental changes to make phone use harder. Assuming you've done at least one of the tweaks, that means you'll start to have more time.</p>

    <p>Today, we'll talk about what to do instead of reaching for your phone.</p>

    <h2>1. Habit Loop Break Down</h2>
    
    <p>The Habit Loop is a three-part neurological pattern that makes up our habits.</p>
    
    <p>It starts with a <strong>cue</strong> - a trigger that initiates a routine (i.e you feel tired or bored).</p>
    
    <p>Second is a <strong>routine</strong> - which is the action you take (i.e. you pick up your phone).</p>
    
    <p>Last is the <strong>reward</strong> - which is what your brain receives from the routine (i.e. you get a dopamine hit from watching the news. Note: This is what makes doom scrolling so addictive, you have a buffet of dopamine hits available 24/7).</p>
    
    <p>So assuming you did your homework from Day 3's email - if you didn't, go back, there's still time! - you have effectively taken out the routine of being able to pick up your phone.</p>
    
    <p>The thing is that, now your initial cue - i.e. boredom - is lonely with no routine to play with.</p>
    
    <p>This means, if you don't replace your phone habit with a new routine, you may feel uncomfortable for longer than you'd like (and blame us for ruining your life!).</p>
    
    <p>So what to do?</p>

    <h2>2. Three Ideas to Remix Your Routine</h2>
    
    <p>So next time that cue of boredom, stress, overwhelmed or a negative emotion hits, instead of grabbing your phone, here's 3 routines you can experiment with:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bring back #ReadingInBed</strong> - Put a book next to your bed and fall in love with reading again. It will also help your sleep! While you're at it, put a book next to places where you would normally use your phone too (i.e on your toilet, sofa, etc).</li>
        <li><strong>Make a morning ritual</strong> - Instead of looking at your phone first thing in the morning, design a simple 15-30 minute morning ritual. This could mean taking a walk, getting some morning sun, doing yoga, a quick HIIT workout, a run, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Make an evening ritual</strong> - At least 30 minutes before bed - this could be combined with #ReadingInBed - try gratitude journaling, an evening stretch, a quick to-do list for the next day, meditation, prep a healthy meal for the next day, or anything that helps you wind down.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You'll find that any of these routines, you will get a reward that is more enjoyable, guilt-free, and far better for your health and productivity than doomscrolling.</p>
    
    <p>One of the main reasons why? You're no longer a zombie glued to your screen. You're brain restores it's natural chemical balance. You are going from a passive life to an active one.</p>
    <p>Give some new routines a try!</p>
    <p>Let us know how they go!</p>
    <p>All the best,</p>
    <p>Manny and Mike</p>

    <p>How do you feel after you read, exercise, take a moment to pause (or meditate) or do something for your health? What would your life look like if you took a moment for yourself everyday?</p>
