    <p>Hi {{.FirstName}},</p>
    
    <p>I'm thrilled you've joined Habits! Let's get you set up for success with your first habit tracking journey.</p>
    
    <h2>What makes a good habit to track?</h2>
    <p>The best habits to track are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific</strong> - "Meditate for 10 minutes" is better than "Be mindful"</li>
        <li><strong>Measurable</strong> - You should be able to clearly say "yes, I did it" or "no, I didn't"</li>
        <li><strong>Achievable</strong> - Start smaller than you think to build momentum</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Creating your first habit</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your first habit:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to your account at <a href="https://habits.co/login">habits.co/login</a></li>
        <li>Click the "+ New Habit" button in the top right</li>
        <li>Name your habit (like "Read for 20 minutes" or "Drink 8 glasses of water")</li>
        <li>Choose an emoji that represents your habit</li>
        <li>Select the habit type (binary, numeric, etc.)</li>
        <li>Click "Create Habit"</li>
    </ol>

    </div>
    
    <p>Once created, you can start tracking your habit right away by clicking on today's date in your habit grid!</p>
    
    <h2>Pro Tip: Start Small</h2>
    <p>Research shows that habits stick better when they're easy to do. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of "Exercise for an hour" try "Do 5 push-ups"</li>
        <li>Instead of "Meditate for 20 minutes" try "Meditate for 2 minutes"</li>
        <li>Instead of "Read a book every week" try "Read 2 pages every day"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can always increase the difficulty once the habit becomes automatic.</p>
