Hi {{.FirstName}},

I'm thrilled you've joined Habits! Let's get you set up for success with your first habit tracking journey.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD HABIT TO TRACK?
The best habits to track are:
- Specific - "Meditate for 10 minutes" is better than "Be mindful"
- Measurable - You should be able to clearly say "yes, I did it" or "no, I didn't"
- Achievable - Start smaller than you think to build momentum

CREATING YOUR FIRST HABIT
Follow these simple steps to create your first habit:
1. Log in to your account at habits.co/login
2. Click the "+ New Habit" button in the top right
3. Name your habit (like "Read for 20 minutes" or "Drink 8 glasses of water")
4. Choose an emoji that represents your habit
5. Select the habit type (binary, numeric, etc.)
6. Click "Create Habit"

Once created, you can start tracking your habit right away by clicking on today's date in your habit grid!

PRO TIP: START SMALL
Research shows that habits stick better when they're easy to do. For example:
- Instead of "Exercise for an hour" try "Do 5 push-ups"
- Instead of "Meditate for 20 minutes" try "Meditate for 2 minutes"
- Instead of "Read a book every week" try "Read 2 pages every day"

You can always increase the difficulty once the habit becomes automatic.

Happy habit building!
