                    Welcome to Habit Tracker, a simple yet powerful tool to help you build and maintain positive habits.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg">
                    Built with Go for scalability and performance, and Alpine.js for simplicity and interactivity, this application represents a labor of love rather than a commercial product. We believe in creating tools that genuinely help people improve their lives, without the constraints of profit-driven development.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg">
                    This is an open-source project focused on providing a clean, distraction-free environment for tracking and building better habits. No ads, no premium features, just pure functionality to support your personal growth journey.
                </p>
